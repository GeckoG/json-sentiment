    "I chose the first three poems because I thought them to be happy, sad, and neutral. I expected to see a significantly positive polarity for \"The Dream\" and negative for \"Though the Last...\". However, that really wasn't the case. In all three instances, the sentiment was fairly neutral. Yes, \"The Dream\" was the most positive, \"Though the Last...\" was most negative, and \"Harp of the North, Farewell\" was the closest to neutral, but not to the extent I was expecting.\n",

    "I think the reasoning for this may be the old English vocabulary used by the poets. Spacytextblob is likely not trained on old English, so it doesn't know what to think of many of the words that are used. While it may pick up on a few things, it can't capture the full sentiment due to the lack of training on texts that use this kind of speech. This would explain the order being correct, but not the magnitude of each.\n",

    "The fourth poem was much longer (238 lines). I was wanting to see if spacy would be more accurate with its polarity if I gave it more to work with. Short answer: it wasn't. This is certainly a negative poem about poverty and hard times, but it was actually given a POSITIVE polarity score. Once again, I think poor training is the likely culprit, with old English and the poetry style of writing throwing off the NLP."
